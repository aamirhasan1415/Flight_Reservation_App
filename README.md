# Flight_Reservation_App

Welcome to my Flight Reservation project! This repository showcases my journey and learning in Spring Boot, Spring MVC, Hibernate, and Microservices.

## Project Highlights

- **Custom Flight Search:** Implemented a custom flight search module in the repository layer, improving flight search functionality.

- **Ticket Generator:** Utilized the iText dependency to create a ticket generator capable of generating personalized PDF tickets for passengers.

- **Email Integration:** Seamlessly integrated a third-party email API to automate the delivery of tickets to passengers' email addresses.

- **Microservices Mastery:** Explored Microservices architecture, enabling two separate projects to run on different servers and interact through APIs. A standalone check-in module was created and seamlessly integrated with the Flight Reservation project using REST APIs.
